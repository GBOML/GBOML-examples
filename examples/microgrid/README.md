This example deals with the sizing and operation of a grid-connected microgrid. The purpose of the model is the select the size of microgrid components (namely solar photovoltaic panels and a battery storage system) so as to minimise the total cost of the system (i.e., including both investment and operating costs) over its lifetime while satisfying pre-specified the (inelastic) electricity demand.

The following nodes are included in the model: solar photovoltaic power plants, battery storage system (Li-ion), demand (appliances consuming electricity), stylised distribution grid (from which electricity can be imported).

Details of the model can be found in the following paper:
